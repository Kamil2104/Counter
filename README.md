Set Reduction:
Users can set a reduction value to decrease the counter by a certain amount (amount of reduction can't be less than -100,000).

Clear Inputs:
Users can reset the input fields for setting counter, boost, and reduction values.

Perform Operations:
Users can add or subtract the boost or reduction values from the counter.

Reset Counter:
Users can reset the counter value to zero.
